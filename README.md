UFO-Level-1: This version met the original homework requirements of loading the table and selecting based on dates
UFO-Level-2: I added a few new features to this page. I added a selection based on states. In addition, I added dropdown select menus to ensure that incorrect selections couldn't be made. I also added a button to reset the table.
